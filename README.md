### Overview 

SupaQ was designed specifically to run various different scenarios on;
* Changes to inter-arrival times
* Changes to service time
* Changes to capacity

And to have pre-packaged interpretability and visuals of;
* Wait Times
* Wait Lists

### Why SupaQ and not other open-source?
* To run simulations where the service node **isn't** emptied
* To have a highly performant DES that can run on any machine
* To provide an off-the-shelf implementation for many of the demands of forecasting in the healthcare sector
